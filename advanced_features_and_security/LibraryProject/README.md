# inroduction to Django


In production, HTTPS is enabled by configuring an SSL/TLS certificate
on the web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache).

The web server is configured to:
- Serve traffic on port 443 (HTTPS)
- Redirect all HTTP (port 80) traffic to HTTPS
- Use valid SSL certificates (e.g., from Let's Encrypt)
